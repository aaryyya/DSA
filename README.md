# Advanced Data Structures in C

This repository contains implementations of various advanced data structures and algorithms in C. The purpose of this project is to provide a collection of commonly used data structures and algorithms, implemented in the C programming language. The files in this repository serve as educational tools to understand and experiment with fundamental and advanced techniques in computer science.

## Contents

The repository includes the following C files:

- **AVL.c**: Implementation of an AVL Tree (Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree).
- **BFSAdjListMatrix.c**: Implementation of Breadth-First Search (BFS) using Adjacency List and Matrix representations.
- **BSTInput.c**: Implementation of Binary Search Tree (BST) with input functionality.
- **BTInput.c**: Binary Tree input operations and structure.
- **DFSwithAdjListnMatrix.c**: Implementation of Depth-First Search (DFS) using Adjacency List and Matrix representations.
- **KruskalList.c**: Kruskal’s Algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using a list-based graph representation.
- **KruskalsMatrix.c**: Kruskal’s Algorithm for finding MST using a matrix-based graph representation.
- **LinearProbingHshing.c**: Linear Probing Hashing technique for hash table implementation.
- **PrimsAdjacencyMatrix.c**: Prim’s Algorithm for finding the MST using Adjacency Matrix representation.
- **PrimsAlgorithmList.c**: Prim’s Algorithm using a list-based graph representation.
- **QuadraticProbing.c**: Implementation of quadratic probing for hash table collision resolution.
- **QueueOperation.c**: Queue operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and display.
- **DoubleHashing.c**: Double Hashing technique for hash table implementation.
- **inpost.c**: Infix to Postfix conversion using stacks.

## Requirements

To compile and run the C programs, you'll need:

- A C compiler (such as GCC or Clang).
- An IDE or text editor for coding (such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Vim).

### Example Compilation Command:
```bash
gcc -o program_name file_name.c
./program_name
